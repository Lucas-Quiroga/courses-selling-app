## API

I integrated the Resend API into the form to receive messages and capture user information. This allows me to establish effective contact with users who submit queries through the form.

I have implemented the Mercado Pago API in a specialized way, incorporating it in a checkout button. When the user clicks on this button, he is redirected to Mercado Pago's secure payment process, guaranteeing a safe transaction for both the user and the seller.
